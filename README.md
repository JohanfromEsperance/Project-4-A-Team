# Fake News Identification using Machine Learning

This Github repository contains the code and resources for our bootcamp project 4, where we have developed a machine learning model to identify fake news. 

## Project Overview
The proliferation of fake news has become a major concern in today's society. To combat the spread of misinformation, we have developed a machine learning model to identify fake news. We have used a dataset containing 1000 news articles, which has been labeled as either fake or real news. The model is built using Scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library in Python. 

## Technologies Used
- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
- JavaScript (Plotly, Leaflet)

## Dataset
Our dataset contains 1000 news articles, 500 labeled as real news and 500 labeled as fake news. The data has been collected from various sources and preprocessed to remove any irrelevant information. The dataset is stored in a CSV file, which is included in the repository.

## Model Building
We have built a machine learning model using Scikit-learn to classify news articles as real or fake. We have used various techniques, such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model selection, to achieve high accuracy. The model is trained on 70% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 30%. We have achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set.

## Project Structure
- `data/` directory contains the dataset in CSV format
- `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis, preprocessing, and model building
- `static/` directory contains CSS and JavaScript files for the web application
- `templates/` directory contains HTML templates for the web application
- `app.py` is the main Python file for the web application
- `model.pkl` is the trained machine learning model in pickle format

## Running the Web Application
To run the web application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python app.py` in the terminal
4. Open the web application in the browser at `http://localhost:5000`

## Future Work
- Improve the accuracy of the model by using more advanced techniques, such as deep learning
- Increase the size of the dataset to improve the generalization of the model
- Deploy the web application on a cloud platform, such as Google Cloud or Amazon AWS

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank our bootcamp instructors for their guidance and support throughout this project. We would also like to thank the creators of the dataset used in this project.
